# Step 1
Firstly create EC2 instance in AWS and using Ubuntu OS as default and leave the other details as it is.
Then in the end of creting a EC2 instance, add script under "Additional settings".
<-----Script----->
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update	
sudo apt install apache2 -y
apache2 -version

<------End------->
Then launch the instance and connect it.

# Step 2
Run the below command after connecting ec2 instance to create apache2 server
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl status apache2

Then run these commands
curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cloudwatch/downloads/latest/awslogs-agent-setup.py -O
sudo apt install python2.7

# Step 3

Then run the command ---> sudo python2.7 ./awslogs-agent-setup.py --region us-east-1
The above command take access key and secret key of IAM user which we have created.So, paste the access and secret key.
Then just click "ENTER" and complete the process.

# Step 4
