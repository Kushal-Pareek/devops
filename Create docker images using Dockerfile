Firstly run 'docker images' command to see the list of all available commands.
Then create a folder with any name like "game" and then go to CMD or powershell and run 'code .' command.
The above step open the VsCode.Then create Dockerfile.

In the docker file we write commands like 
<----example--->
FROM nginx:latest   #base image
COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html  #copy content from current folder to nginx html page
<-----end------->

Open the terminal and run the below commands
$ docker build -t game .
$ docker tag game kushalpareek/game
$ docker login
$ docker push kushalpareek/game
$ docker run --name "kp" -p 27017 kushalpareek/game


NOTE :- If someone wants to download the image then run
$docker pull kushalpareek/game
