Firstly go to vs code and create a folder and then create a file "Dockerfile".
NOTE:- The name of file is depends on user

Secondly,If we want to create CPP compiler using gcc then we use the below code
<-----Start----->
# gcc as base image
FROM gcc:latest

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY ./code.cpp /app

# Compile the C++ program using gcc
RUN g++ -o myprogram code.cpp

CMD ["./myprogram"]

<-------End-------->
NOTE:- We can take code from Docker hub.

At the end,RUN below commands
$ docker build -t <name_of_image> -f <name_of_currentdirectory> .        # if name of directory is not "Dockerfile"
$ docker run -itd <name_of_image>
$ docker exec -itd <id_of_container> <command_of_container>
